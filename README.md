# coffeeShopSimulator
This is a simulation for a coffee where customers are served by robots
Customers are initialized randomly and inserted in a queue(link list implementation) in respects of arrival time and customer type
- Dequeued by robots with the serve function
- All the management of the functions done inside main function
- Programs main output is giving statistics about coffee shop, robots, coffees, time spent on line
- There are functions commented in main you might want to try them to see clearly what program does
- I've added as much as comment that i can
***I hope you enjoy!***
